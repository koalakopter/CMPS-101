FILES PROVIDED

List.c: Provides an ADT for a doubly Linked List with each list object containing an integer. Also provides several necessary functions as described in the assignment description. Not all functions were used, but all are useful in various ways to manipulate the list.

List.h: Provides function declarations for the above List.c file

Lex.c: The main class which reads in an input file and alphabatizes a series of Strings by placing the positions into the above described List and then sorting it. The program then uses the list to print out an alphabatized list of the input Strings

Makefile: Provided by the professor. Simply builds and compiles all files currently in the same directory as the Makefile. Also includes a case for compiling a Test.c, which I used for other tests 

ListClient.c: Provides a series of tests for testing the List.c file. Quite rudimentary and I wrote my own testing client, although it has not been provides since it was not asked for.
