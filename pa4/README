CRUZ ID: jcto
pa4: Graph.c and BFS
Professor Tantalo

PROVIDED FILES:
List.h: From pa2, provides function declarations for List.c

List.c: From pa2, provides functionality for a Doubly Linked List ADT.

Graph.h: Provides function declarations for Graph.c, and a struct declaration of type Graph.

Graph.c: Implements the functions described in Graph.h and the lab manual.

GraphTest.c: A testing environment that I wrote to test some Graph.c functions in isolation and to test edge cases.

FindPath.c: The main file of this program. Defines a main function that constructs a graph as a representation of Lists. Then, in the second half, finds the shortest path found by BFS from a source vertex to another vertex.

Makefile: Provided by the professor, makes the above programs when you type "make"
